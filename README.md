Repo for my UROP (2022)

This serves as the hub for the work done on my UROP of 2022. It is based of the work done by
Samuel Adams in the second year of his PhD [1]. The project started off working with the analytic cases
in order to gain familiarity with the problem, before moving onto finite differences and progressively
modelling increasingly complicated situations. This repo includes both code and a report.
